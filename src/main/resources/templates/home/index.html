				<div class="section-subheading center">If you don&#x27;t pay attention to changing technology you can quickly find yourself falling behind the industry. We all need to pay attention to changes and continuously evaluate those changes to see if industry changes help or hurt us. <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">Thoughtworks</a> came up with a great concept, the Technology Radar to help keep track of this.  A technology radar lets you keep track of your assessments of the risks and rewards of various areas of technology, and by joining this site you can manage your own technology radar.</div>

						<h3>Have Multiple Versions</h3>
						<p>Your opinion of things can and should change over time. Something that was the defacto standard once upon a time has more than likely been kicked to the curb by newer ways of doing things. Keep track of how you feel about things over time and be able to look at that history when you need to remember why you chose something.</p>
